# Mogra (મોગરા) Gujarati + Latin Fonts Project

Fast, flamboyant and entirely inventive. Mogra is a font that looks to explore how an informal multi-script typeface should look and behave. Blending strong characteristics from Indian street lettering into a functioning typeface for both Latin and Gujarati scripts has allowed the project to adopt many interesting aesthetic features. The Gujarati, unlike many designs for this writing system, emphasises the final out-stroke with pride. Diminutive, it is not. Visual similarities to the Devanagari script are thrown out of the window. Who needs a shirorekha anyway? Conceptually, the great balance between the sharp edges and soft curves, much like it’s namesake, the Mogra flower, enables ingenuity in contrast, texture and appearance.

The Latin companion is no shrinking violet, either. A traditionally indic angle of a broad-nibbed pen is applied to this script with real fun and creativity. Weight is added in unexpected places but this doesn’t get in the way of a very consistent and sparkling texture. Because of how these elements combine with each other the latin harmonises well with the Gujarati while keeping its own distinct personality.
