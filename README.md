# Mogra (મોગરા) Gujarati + Latin Fonts Project

Mogra is a display typeface that supports the Gujarati and Latin scripts.
With dense letterforms that borrow heavily from a broad-nibbed marker, Mogra emphasises the definitive Gujarati out-stroke with mass, weight, and flair. 
The implied bloating of the marker pen creates an interesting roundness that contrasts against the relatively fixed angle the pen holds.
